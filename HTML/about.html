					The Libraries For Kids project is a program that was set up by Sathana Selvam through her high school library club to buy books for children in India. <br><br>

					In 2013, the club was able to fundraise and establish 2 libraries in rural Indian schools. The project was a success. Schools reported that children wanted school to be open on Saturday to read in the library and that their overall academic performance had improved.<br><br>

					After receiving positive feedback from the schools, the club decided to further expand the project in the summer of 2014, establishing four more libraries. These books have given the children a new medium to expand their knowledge. <br><br>

					The Book for Kids in India program would like to continue this effort to help these impoverished children&#39;s education and will continue fund raising!
